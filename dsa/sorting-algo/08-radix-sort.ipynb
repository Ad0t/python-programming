    "# Radix Sort\n",
    "Radix Sort is a linear sorting algorithm that sorts elements by processing them digit by digit. It is an efficient sorting algorithm for integers or strings with fixed-size keys.  \n",
    "Rather than comparing elements directly, Radix Sort distributes the elements into buckets based on each digitâ€™s value. By repeatedly sorting the elements by their significant digits, from the least significant to the most significant, Radix Sort achieves the final sorted order.\n",
    "## Radix Sort Algorithm\n",
    "The key idea behind Radix Sort is to exploit the concept of place value. It assumes that sorting numbers digit by digit will eventually result in a fully sorted list. Radix Sort can be performed using different variations, such as Least Significant Digit (LSD) Radix Sort or Most Significant Digit (MSD) Radix Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the largest element in the array, e.g.- 802. It has three digits, so we will iterate three times, once for each significant place\n",
    "2. Sort the elements based on the unit place digits(X=0). We use a stable sorting technique, such as counting sort, to sort the digits at each significant place\n",
    "3. Sort elements based on ones \n",
    "4. Sort elements based on tens \n",
    "5. Sort elements based on hundreds "

    "## Complexity Analysis of Radix Sort:\n",
    "### Time Complexity: \n",
    "- Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping the keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value. It has a time complexity of O(d * (n + b)), where d is the number of digits, n is the number of elements, and b is the base of the number system being used.\n",
    "- In practical implementations, radix sort is often faster than other comparison-based sorting algorithms, such as quicksort or merge sort, for large datasets, especially when the keys have many digits. However, its time complexity grows linearly with the number of digits, and so it is not as efficient for small datasets.\n",
    "### Auxiliary Space: \n",
    "- Radix sort also has a space complexity of O(n + b), where n is the number of elements and b is the base of the number system. This space complexity comes from the need to create buckets for each digit value and to copy the elements back to the original array after each digit has been sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Radix Sort:\n",
    "- Radix sort has a linear time complexity, which makes it faster than comparison-based sorting algorithms such as quicksort and merge sort for large data sets.\n",
    "- It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output.\n",
    "- Radix sort is efficient for sorting large numbers of integers or strings.\n",
    "- It can be easily parallelized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages of Radix Sort:\n",
    "- Radix sort is not efficient for sorting floating-point numbers or other types of data that cannot be easily mapped to a small number of digits.\n",
    "- It requires a significant amount of memory to hold the count of the number of times each digit value appears.\n",
    "- It is not efficient for small data sets or data sets with a small number of unique keys.\n",
    "- It requires that the data being sorted can be represented in a fixed number of digits, which may not be the case for some types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of Radix Sort\n",
    "- In a typical computer, which is a sequential random-access machine, where the records are keyed by multiple fields radix sort is used. For eg., you want to sort on three keys month, day, and year. You could compare two records on year, then on a tie on month and finally on the date. Alternatively, sorting the data three times using Radix sort first on the date, then on month, and finally on year could be used.\n",
    "- It was used in card sorting machines with 80 columns, and in each column, the machine could punch a hole only in 12 places. The sorter was then programmed to sort the cards, depending upon which place the card had been punched. This was then used by the operator to collect the cards which had the 1st row punched, followed by the 2nd row, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key points about Radix Sort:\n",
    "- It makes assumptions about the data like the data must be between a range of elements.\n",
    "- The input array must have elements with the same radix and width.\n",
    "- Radix sort works on sorting based on an individual digit or letter position.\n",
    "- We must start sorting from the rightmost position and use a stable algorithm at each position.\n",
    "- Radix sort is not an in-place algorithm as it uses a temporary count array"
