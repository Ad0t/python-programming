    "# Merge Sort\n",
    "Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and stability. It follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by recursively dividing the input array into two halves, recursively sorting the two halves and finally merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.\n",
    "1. *Divide*:  Divide the list or array recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided. \n",
    "2. *Conquer*:  Each subarray is sorted individually using the merge sort algorithm. \n",
    "3. *Merge*:  The sorted subarrays are merged back together in sorted order. The process continues until all elements from both subarrays have been merged. "

    "## Complexity Analysis of Merge Sort\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- Best Case: O(n log n), When the array is already sorted or nearly sorted.\n",
    "- Average Case: O(n log n), When the array is randomly ordered.\n",
    "- Worst Case: O(n log n), When the array is sorted in reverse order.\n",
    "### Auxiliary Space: \n",
    "- O(n), Additional space is required for the temporary array used during merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Merge Sort\n",
    "- Stability : Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the input array.\n",
    "- Guaranteed worst-case performance: Merge sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(N logN) , which means it performs well even on large datasets.\n",
    "- Simple to implement: The divide-and-conquer approach is straightforward.\n",
    "- Naturally Parallel : We independently merge subarrays that makes it suitable for parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages of Merge Sort\n",
    "- Space complexity: Merge sort requires additional memory to store the merged sub-arrays during the sorting process.\n",
    "- Not in-place: Merge sort is not an in-place sorting algorithm, which means it requires additional memory to store the sorted data. This can be a disadvantage in applications where memory usage is a concern.\n",
    "- Merge Sort is Slower than QuickSort in general as QuickSort is more cache friendly because it works in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of Merge Sort:\n",
    "- Sorting large datasets\n",
    "- External sorting (when the dataset is too large to fit in memory)\n",
    "- Inversion counting\n",
    "- Merge Sort and its variations are used in library methods of programming languages.\n",
    "    - Its variation TimSort is used in Python, Java Android and Swift. The main reason why it is preferred to sort non-primitive types is stability which is not there in QuickSort.\n",
    "    - Arrays.sort in Java uses QuickSort while Collections.sort uses MergeSort.\n",
    "- It is a preferred algorithm for sorting Linked lists.\n",
    "- It can be easily parallelized as we can independently sort subarrays and then merge.\n",
    "- The merge function of merge sort to efficiently solve the problems like union and intersection of two sorted arrays."
